## Stejara Dinulescu

I am a first year MAT PhD student from Dallas, Texas (originally born in Romania, but I've lived in Texas almost all of my life). I come from SMU, where I received my bachelors degrees in Studio Art (BA), Psychology (BS), and Creative Computing (BA). Throughout my undergrad studies, I've been interested in motion capture systems that utilize motion from the human body to drive visualizations and audio. I am excited to begin my PhD and to further explore creative coding!
