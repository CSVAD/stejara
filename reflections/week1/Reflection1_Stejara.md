Cybrnetics, Art, and Ideas by Jasia Reichardt 

I was primarily interested in the final couple of page of this article, especially when Reichardt states that "there is no reason why significant works should not be based on misunderstandings and partially digested information" (page 7). A common assumption being made when introducing computers into the art realm is an assumption of reliance on mathematical functions, patterns, and concrete/linear processes. This extends itself to the idea of a "correct" output; however, we would not normally associate "correctness" with traditional artworks. Therefore, why should we have to apply this linear logic to machine-created artworks? Instead, it is interesting to me to celebrate flaws in patterns. For example, why do we need to create a chat bot that speaks/seems to understand input "perfectly" when we can celebrate in its flaws or "incorrectness" in following user-specified rules/regulations? I especially loved the section on Paik and Cage, which highlighted how aesthetic merit can be found in incorrect pairings of words, even though they follow a "logical" pattern. In this way, we can observe the quirks in everyday systems (in this case, language) and ahcieve a greater understanding of these systems.

Symbols from Abstracting Craft by Malcolm McCullough

The idea of computation as types of user-defined symbol systems/schemes has been something that I haven't really stopped to think about, even though it is extremely obvious in hindsight (there is a reason why programming is described as a "language," where they each have their own syntax and structures). It is also extremely interesting to me how traditional art was considered to be separate from symbol schemes, as a symbol contains a specific meaning whereas in a sketch, the same visual component (i.e. a line) can lead to different outputs. However now, with the evolution of computational art, we are now using symbol schemes to produce creative outputs.

I was also very excited about the association of programming to increasing abstraction. Normally, people would consider programming to be equilivant to something more technical (i.e. mathematics). However, all science is in fact a way to abstractly explain phenomena around us in a way that is easier for us to understand through symbols and structures (moving from data structures to object-oriented paradigms, etc.) 

One of my questions while parsing this article is whether progamming followed similar historical patterns to art and music, i.e. the establishment of a set of rules and the breaking of those rules to establish new sets of rules (in art, the existance of an avant guarde). The article makes it seem as if there is no breaking of rules, just a development of symbolic structures to allow for more flexibility and higher abstractions. However, it does point out how "rigorous symbolic contexts may help articulate qualities of imagination, [but] they are no substitute for insight," meaning we are loosing something with the use of symbol systems (which Searle describes as affect). Thus, a combination (and in fact the movement across each of these spectrums) of symbolic processing and what the author calls "the use of tacit knowledge" is required to design creative and complex systems. I guess this is similar to the historical movements of avante guards in the art world and the music world, as we are beginning to break previously held assumptions and strict rulesets to produce different outputs.
