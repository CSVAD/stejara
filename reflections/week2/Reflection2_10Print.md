## Reflection 2: 10Print
## Stejara Dinulescu

Reflection:
There was a lot to comment on/unpack in this reading, but I want to focus on the idea of merit, as it was discussed last class briefly. I really enjoyed the particular bit in the beginning where the authors talk about how visual interest is the product of repetition--which our brains relish in, because as humans we are attune to discovering patterns in the world around us and our everyday activities--as well as the breaking of this repetition, which leads to excitement that maintains our interest (this, I believe, occurs because it makes us subconsciously uncomfortable, as the breaking of the pattern breaks our expectations). I was also really interested in the portion where the authors discuss how changing exciting visual combinations in any way (in regards to the 10Print system) will lead to less exciting outcomes. This, in my opinion, then begins to pair with the idea of merit. An artistic piece is "finished" or "excellent" when any other imagined combination of the structure of the piece (i.e. the removal of a line here, a form there, etc.) is less exciting than the current product. This does account for the idea that iterations of the product can be exciting in it's own way: in this case, the iterative parts become a series that can be powerful in itself.


Notes from the Reading:
- idea of anticipation of pattern pulling with variations in this pattern
- "calculated dose of randomness" is what intrigues the viewer
- perhaps related to our desire to categorize and seek patterns?
    - idea of order
    - what we see in nature
    - mathematical relationships
- grid is essential to design -> 2D regularity
- visual interest is the product of the repetition + the breakage of such repetition
    - changing this combination in any way will lead to something less interesting
    - I guess this is how you decide the merit of a work?
- pattern begins with simplicity -> a simple element repeated can yield complex patterns
- perhaps irregularities attract us because they make us uncomfortable -> hold our attention because it is unexpected
- decorative craft versus art? same? different? overlapping
- i like the description of computer programs (that are based on repetition -> i.e. loops) as looms (allows for rapid prototyping of pattern)
- distortion of grids -> adding tension between artists who celebrate mathematical form and those who want to be more subjective/introduce emotion
- vera molnar: to create her works she imagined she had a computer and then built a process to create her art
- grid = program -> Gerstener
    - grid systematizes artistic creation & presents challenging & generative platform for experimentation
- relationship between grid system and television + gaming
    - computer visuals begin with a grid -> same with processing code I realize
- temporal rhythms -> repetition in time
    - appearance of motion
    - idea of process
- kinetic rhythm -> Gabo's Kinetic Construction (same process over and over)
- this lead to work for screens -> film and animation
    - repetition in film, music, etc.
- regularity becomes a paradigm of the computational age
- powerful: repeating sequence of instructions
    - loop (bounded or unbounded) -> GOTO becomes the basis for for and while loops
        - for an iterative process
    - branching -> conditions
    - processing order is powerful here
- leads to performances based on looping (not actually with a computer) -> Step Piece
    - leads to idea of improvement over time (practice) as a human or machine
    - different iterations based on what night it is performed -> interesting differences
