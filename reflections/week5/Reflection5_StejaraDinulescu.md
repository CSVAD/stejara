## Reflection 5: Bret Victor

This idea of creating a tool that allows the artist to actually draw dynamically (as opposed to relying on a linguistic, abstract tool like code, which doesn't actually lend itself to "drawing") is an interesting idea, especially as it allows for creativity and a reliance on the visual mathematics (geometry) versus linguistic mathematics (algebra). This seems like a very logical and natural order for tools and their different application. However, I am not sure how beneficial it would be to make the disctinction between code for science and a dynamic drawing tool for art. I feel like while it gives a little more creative flexibility, it could provide a harmful classification or distinction betwen "scientists" versus "artists," which I don't believe is the most healthy for creativity and collaboration. I do believe that artists should have code knowledge and the ability to think abstractly and symbolically, in the same way that scientists should have the ability to think creatively. These tools are definitely great to have, but I think in the future that it may constrain the disctinctions between scientist and artist.


## Notes
Dynamic Pictures (essay)
- dynamic pictures will someday be the primary medium for visual art and explanations
	- pictures change when you change some input (varied params)
	- can be interactive (i.e. dragging, flicking)
- need means to draw dynamic pictures
- most images are static today -> same for everyone, can't adapt to surroundings or unique interests, etc.
- dynamic drawings deal with abstract text (i.e. code)
	- however this is not actually drawing (manipulation of the picture itself)
- dynamic drawings will enable people to understand through visual explanations unique to user and can change based on the input data
- need drawing tool for dynamic pictures
- magic ink: artist draws static snapshots corresponding to set of example params, tool infers the mapping between the params and the elements in the picture
- substroke: parameterized transformations

Stop Drawing Dead Fish (video)
- using digital media to emulate older media (ex. painting) -> but this is not a new art form
- simulation
- behavior/responsiveness is essence of computer as an art medium
	- just like humans, animals, fish, etc., live things have motion
	- have motivation, responses
- human as performer/controller to make things more "alive"
	- collaborative dynamic between human + art
	- simple performance control can add a lot to the simulation (fluently express a range of motion
	- interplay between two living, behaving beings -> symbiosis, back and forth between simulation and human controller
- artist experiences tension at the same time as the audience -> artist is like a viewer almost (listening to the emotions in the body)
- code is not a good way to do this -> code is a linguistic description, the scene has to be created by someone thinking visually
- creating behaviors by direct manipulation of art objects themselves -> tool in part 2 of video
- geometry/algebra are two different ways to understand mathematics
	- geometry: visual/spatial perception
	- algebra: linguistic understanding
