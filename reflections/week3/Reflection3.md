Uses: 
- picking lights for a scene/rendering
- volume rendering (opacity and color transfer functions)
- motion control in animation
	- Hopper Dog -> allows for stylistic and physically attainable unique gaits

Design as Exploration: Creating Interface Alternatives through Parallel Authoring and Runtime Tuning
- programs that run in tandem to deliver different options -> increase creativity and overall output
- allows for parallel editing, parallel execution, and tuning
- are alternative designs related enough in practice to benefit from linked editing and tuning?
- allows for quicker creation with less confusion based on participant studies
- live improvisation/tuning allows for more flexible options and better outputs than Design Galleries

## Reflection 3

These are both two really interesting examples in HCI of allowing the user to manipulate parameters of a system in order to achieve different iterations of a desired outcome. This helps supplement creativity, allowing the user the ability to focus on the different iterations of output in order to choose the best iteration instead of wasting time trying to tune parameters to find an aesthetic outcome. In this way, the machine helps supplement the "grunt work," allowing the user to be able to assert creative authority. This is particularly helpful, as in my experience, parameter adjustment is often the trickiest and most annoying part of developing a successful system. These two papers show two systems that create iterative output (one of them allowing for real-time tuning) in order to look at output options side-by-side; this ability of comparison is particularly essential for creative output, as we saw through our repetition projects last class. Looking at and comparing different outputs together helps us make aesthetic and creative decisions that we otherwise couldn't have come to as easily if we looked at one output by itself. I'm really excited in particular about the second paper, which allows for real-time tuning of parameters. The further development of such systems will allow for an even greater move towards an emphasis on creativity versus pure procedure--however, do we lose something when computers are creating the desired outcomes? Will we still have the "beautiful accidents" that happen when a person is trying to adjust parameters themselves?
