## Drawing Tool Reflection
# Stejara Dinulescu

In creating my drawing tool, I wanted to be able to have the user and the computer make decisions in tandem that aren't necessarily based on one another. That way, the computer is its own "autonomous" agent that adds variation to the user's drawing. While the user does have control of specific parameters and can adjust accordingly, oftentimes the computer will make adjustments on its own that can drastically change the intentions of the user in order to create a surprising outcome. In general, drawing tools allow the user complete control of texture, color, shape, etc. While the options that these other tools allow for are really exciting (particularly with textures), I was really impressed by the work created by Sougwen Chung ("Drawing Operations"), where she draws in tandem with a robot arm. The beauty of this work is how aesthetically connected the robot drawings are to her own drawings -> this is visual flow between the two. However, I wanted to create a program that allowed for a more spontaneous, maybe less fluid connect between the computer's decisions and the user's desires. That way, the two are almost drawing with their eyes closed in order to achieve a surprising outcome.
