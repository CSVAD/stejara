## Project7 Reflection - Stejara Dinulescu

I wanted people to be able to pick colors for drawing based on an easy-to-use, simple GUI. They are able to generate colors that they desire to use based on available color schemes (random, red, blue, green, and a selected feature that allows them to generate their own palette based on a color they like). I wanted to expose very simple functions that are easy for the user to program: that is why I have only exposed a setup, a draw for the palette, a "paint" feature that allows for drawing or a "changeBackground" feature that allows for background changing that depends on the selected color, and a function that handles all mouse clicking. I selected the naming conventions based on functions that are easy to understand what they are used for (i.e. descriptive/readable to the user, based on Bret Victor's reading from last week). While this library may be limited for what the user can do because of its simplicity, I think that it is reasonably easy for the user to incorporate in more complicated sketches without much of a struggle. I would like to expand this library later to include more drawing features!
