## Final Project Presentation

Challenges: 
- Researching and picking a GAN that does what I want
- Understanding the code behind the GAN and being able to manipulate it
- Compiling a training dataset and/or using an available one

Design Challenges:
- Being able to distinguish my product (idea of originality with someone else's code)
- Making the work stand alone as a work of digital art (isn't attempting to be a perfect "painting", etc.)

Evaulate the success of project: 
- Generate works that are different from one another
- The works themselves are unique (even though I am using other people's code)
