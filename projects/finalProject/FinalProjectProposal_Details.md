## Final Project Presentation

Machine Learning -> Generated artworks
Challenges: 
- Researching and picking a GAN that does what I want
- Understanding the code behind the GAN and being able to manipulate it
- Compiling a training dataset and/or using an available one

Design Challenges:
- Being able to distinguish my product (idea of originality with someone else's code)
- Making the work stand alone as a work of digital art (isn't attempting to be a perfect "painting", etc.)

Evaulate the success of project: 
- Generate works that are different from one another
- The works themselves are unique (even though I am using other people's code)


Potential other project: 
Generated works created through motion capture...
More comfortable with this...
Body as the GUI?

Challenges: 
- What would I use as algorithm? Frame differencing (my own algorithm), openCV built-in functions, optical flow, etc.?
- How do I want to map the body?

Design Challenges: 
- Aesthetic decisions for the artwork
- Sound related to the artwork, aesthetic decisions of sound

Evaluate the success of the project: 
- Making the different images unique enough
- Artwork and sound are aesthetically exciting
- System is intuitive for the user, anyone can create works on my system





Notes:
- Start with runwayML
- Not necessary to focus too much on output
