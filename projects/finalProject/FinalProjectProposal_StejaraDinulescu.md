## Final Project Proposal - Stejara Dinulescu

I would like to pick option 2 for my final project (create a series of generative artworks). I really liked the second "wallpaper" project, as well as the project where we exposed parameters to create shapes/forms. I am interested in creating a GUI that would allow me to make diffeerent iterations of works (that utilize repetition and randomness), but I am also toying with the idea of potentially using a machine learning algorithm to do this in order to generate "painterly" images based on a training data set (similar to examples seen by Memo Akten). I am especially interested in exploring the communication between user and machine in creating artwork--thus, my motivation behind these works will be to work with my computer in order to create aesthetic drawings.
